You are going to learn about two-dimensional (2D) arrays by studying some theory and having a go at the challenges given.

Here is an example of two-dimensional data:

```java
// String data
{"Name","Age","Color","Car"},
{"Alice","21","Red", "Audi"},
{"Tariq","12","Blue","Mike"},
{"Bob","35","Green","Gayle"}

// Integer data
{0,1,2,3},
{0,1,2,3},
{0,1,2,3}
```

Here is how the data would be represented in a two-dimensional array:

```java
// String data type 2D array
String[][] people = {
  {"Name","Age","Color","Car"},
  {"Alice","21","Red", "Audi"},
  {"Tariq","12","Blue","Mike"},
  {"Bob","35","Green","Gayle"}
};

// Integer data type 2D array
int[][] multi = {
  {0,1,2,3},
  {0,1,2,3},
  {0,1,2,3}
};
```
